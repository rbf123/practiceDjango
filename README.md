1. Fortune Teller app
   - This is a simple fortuneteller app created using Django- a web framework for python, HTML and some CSS for styling.
   - Users will receive a random message of the day.
   - Users who don't like their original fortune and horoscope can click the button to reroll and get a new prediction.

Whenever the website is loaded, Django calls on the view functions to select random fortunes from the lists and populates a template to send back to the client.

Sample photo attached shows the fortuneteller app's output, giving users a fortune and horoscope of the day.
